FishBase table,FishBase column,OSMOSE property,Default value,Notes from Arnaud
species,LongevityWild,species.lifespan.sp,0,Longevity. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,K,species.K.sp,0.0,Instantaneous growth rate at small size. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,Loo,species.lInf.sp,0.0,Maximum size. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,to,species.t0.sp,0.0,Theoretical age of zero length. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
poplw,a,species.length2weight.condition.factor.sp,0.0,Constant of proportionality of the allometric length-weight relationship. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
poplw,b,species.length2weight.allometric.power.sp,0.0,Exponent of the allometric length-weight relationship. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
maturity,Lm,species.maturity.size.sp,0.0,Size at sexual maturity. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
,,species.maturity.age.sp,0.0,Age at sexual maturity. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Please have a look at jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge#15
,,species.vonbertalanffy.threshold.age.sp,0.0,Threshold age below which a linear growth model is used to calculate mean length increase. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind  
,,species.length2weight.fl.sp,0.0,Length-weight relationship estimated for total lengths (TLs)?: Boolean variable. This is a parameter that I created for the OSMOSE-WFS model but which will undoubtedly be useful for other OSMOSE applications. This parameter could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind  
,,species.relativefecundity.sp,0.0,Annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind    
,,species.sexratio.sp,0.0,Female:male sex ratio. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
