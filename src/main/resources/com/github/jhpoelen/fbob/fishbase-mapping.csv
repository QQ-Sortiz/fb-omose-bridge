FishBase table,FishBase column,OSMOSE property,Default value,Notes from Arnaud
species,LongevityWild,species.lifespan.sp,0,Longevity. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,K,species.K.sp,0.0,Instantaneous growth rate at small size. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,Loo,species.lInf.sp,0.0,Maximum size. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popgrowth,to,species.t0.sp,0.0,Theoretical age of zero length. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
poplw,a,species.length2weight.condition.factor.sp,0.0,Constant of proportionality of the allometric length-weight relationship. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
poplw,b,species.length2weight.allometric.power.sp,0.0,Exponent of the allometric length-weight relationship. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
maturity,Lm,species.maturity.size.sp,0.0,Size at sexual maturity. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
maturity,tm,species.maturity.age.sp,0.0,Age at sexual maturity. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase. 
?,?,species.vonbertalanffy.threshold.age.sp,0.0,Threshold age below which a linear growth model is used to calculate mean length increase. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. The following issue needs to be addressed: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/23 
poplw,Type,species.length2weight.fl.sp,0.0,Length-weight relationship estimated for total lengths (TLs)?: Boolean variable. This is a parameter that I created for the OSMOSE-WFS model but which will undoubtedly be useful for other OSMOSE applications. This parameter can easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase  
,,species.relativefecundity.sp,,Annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind    
,,species.sexratio.sp,,Female:male sex ratio. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,predation.ingestion.rate.max.osmose.sp,,Maximum annual ingestion rate expressed in grams of food per gram of individual and per year. This parameter is usually set to 3.5 g of food per g of individual and per year for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. It is similar to Ecopath's Q/B parameter. This parameter could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind 
,,predation.efficiency.critical.sp,,Critical predation efficiency. This parameter is usually set to 0.57 for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. This is a parameter that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind    
,,mortality.starvation.rate.max.sp,,Maximum annual starvation mortality. This parameter is usually set to 0.3 year-1 for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models.This is a parameter that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind    
,,predation.predPrey.sizeRatio.min.sp,,Minimum predator/prey size ratios defined for juveniles (immature individuals) and adults (mature individuals) of each focal functional group. NB: the predator/prey size ratios of juveniles and adults of a given focal functional group can be identical if this makes sense from an ecological standpoint. These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Deng Palomares once mentioned that Predator/prey size ratios could be estimated by FishBase/SeaLifeBase from a calculation of gape size; gape size can be obtained as a percentage of total length (see morphometrics in FishBase/SeaLifeBase) 
,,predation.predPrey.sizeRatio.max.sp,,Maximum predator/prey size ratios defined for juveniles (immature individuals) and adults (mature individuals) of each focal functional group. NB: the predator/prey size ratios of juveniles and adults of a given focal functional group can be identical if this makes sense from an ecological standpoint. These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Deng Palomares once mentioned that Predator/prey size ratios could be estimated by FishBase/SeaLifeBase from a calculation of gape size; gape size can be obtained as a percentage of total length (see morphometrics in FishBase/SeaLifeBase) 
maturity,Lm,predation.predPrey.stage.threshold.sp,0.0,Body size threshold that separates the predator/prey size ratio for juvenile individuals and the predator/prey size ratio for adult individuals. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
,,first rows of the matrix given in predation-accessibility.csv,,matrix of the accessibility coefficients of life stages of focal functional groups to each other. This is a parameter that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,predation.accessibility.stage.threshold.sp,,Age threshold that separates the accessibility coefficients of the life stages of the focal functional group of interest
,,vector given in reproduction-seasonality-sp csv files,,Seasonality of reproduction = monthly proportions of annual spawning if the time step of the OSMOSE model is one month. These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,plankton.TL.plk,,Trophic level of a background functional group. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,plankton.size.min.plk,,Minimum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,plankton.size.max.plk,,Maximum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
,,last rows of the matrix given in predation-accessibility.csv,,matrix of the theoretical accessibility coefficients of background functional groups to the life stages of focal functional groups. These could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind
