maturity,tm,species.maturity.age.sp,2.0,Age at sexual maturity. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase. 
?,?,species.vonbertalanffy.threshold.age.sp,1.0,Threshold age below which a linear growth model is used to calculate mean length increase. This is a parameter that could easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. The following issue needs to be addressed: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/23 
fecundity,RelFecundityMean and SpawningCycles,species.relativefecundity.sp,0.0,Annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase; for a given focal functional group the RelFecundity and SpawningCycles parameters can be extracted from  FishBase/SeaLifeBase and multiplied together to get an estimate of annual number of eggs per gram of mature female. Definitions of RelFecundity and SpawningCycles can be found at: ropensci/fishbaseapi/blob/master/docs/docs-sources/fecundity.csv
spawning,SexRatiomid,species.sexratio.sp,0.5,Female:male sex ratio. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase. Nota bene: SexRatiomid in FishBase's spawning.csv is the percentage of spawning females in spawning stock; female:male sex ratio in OSMOSE is a quantity lower than 1
popqb,PopQB,predation.ingestion.rate.max.sp,3.5,Maximum annual ingestion rate expressed in grams of food per gram of individual and per year. This parameter is usually set to 3.5 g of food per g of individual and per year for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. It is similar to Ecopath's Q/B parameter. This parameter can be directly obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popqb,MaintQB,popqb.MaintQB,0.57,needed for calculation of predator.efficiency.critical.sp
popqb,MaintQB and PopQB,predation.efficiency.critical.sp,0.57,Critical predation efficiency. This is the predation efficiency ensuring body maintenance. This parameter is usually set to 0.57 for all focal functional groups in OSMOSE models. This is a parameter can easily be obtained by extracting the MaintQB and PopQB parameters in FishBase's popqb.csv and dividing the former parameter by the latter.
?,?,predation.predPrey.sizeRatio.max.sp,1.0,Minimum predator/prey size ratios defined for juveniles (immature individuals) and adults (mature individuals) of each focal functional group. NB: the predator/prey size ratios of juveniles and adults of a given focal functional group can be identical if this makes sense from an ecological standpoint. These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Deng Palomares once mentioned that Predator/prey size ratios could be estimated by FishBase/SeaLifeBase from a calculation of gape size; gape size can be obtained as a percentage of total length (see morphometrics in FishBase/SeaLifeBase). Please address the following issue: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/32
?,?,predation.predPrey.sizeRatio.min.sp,10000.0,Maximum predator/prey size ratios defined for juveniles (immature individuals) and adults (mature individuals) of each focal functional group. NB: the predator/prey size ratios of juveniles and adults of a given focal functional group can be identical if this makes sense from an ecological standpoint. These are parameters that could possibly be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase to my mind. Deng Palomares once mentioned that Predator/prey size ratios could be estimated by FishBase/SeaLifeBase from a calculation of gape size; gape size can be obtained as a percentage of total length (see morphometrics in FishBase/SeaLifeBase). Please address the following issue: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/32 
maturity,Lm,predation.predPrey.stage.threshold.sp,10.0,Body size threshold that separates the predator/prey size ratio for juvenile individuals and the predator/prey size ratio for adult individuals. This is a parameter that can easily be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
ecology and estimatedepth,Benthic Demersal and Pelagic (from ecology) and Depth min and Depth Max (from estimatedepth),first rows of the matrix given in predation-accessibility.csv,0.8,matrix of the accessibility coefficients of life stages of focal functional groups to each other. These are parameters that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase as described in the following issue: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/93
maturity,tm,predation.accessibility.stage.threshold.sp,2.0,Age threshold that separates the accessibility coefficients of juvenile and adult stages of focal functional groups. This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase.   
spawning,Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov and Dec,vector given in reproduction-seasonality-sp csv files,0.0833,Seasonality of reproduction = monthly proportions of annual spawning if the time step of the OSMOSE model is one month. These are parameters that can easily be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase's spawning table. Please mind the following issue: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/3
estimate,Troph,plankton.TL.plk,0.0,Trophic level of a background functional group. This parameter can be obtained directly from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
popll,LengthMin,plankton.size.min.plk,0.001,Minimum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase. (1) The minimum size of all the reference species of the background functional group could be obtained through the bridge between FishBase/SeaLifeBase and OSMOSE simply by extracting LenghMin parameters from the popll table. (2) A minimum size could be defined for the background functional group as the minimum over all the minimum sizes of reference species.   
popll,LengthMax,plankton.size.max.plk,10.0,Maximum size of a background functional group. This is a parameter that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase. (1) The maximum size of all the reference species of the background functional group could be obtained through the bridge between FishBase/SeaLifeBase and OSMOSE simply by extracting LenghMax parameters from the popll table. (2) A maximum size could be defined for the background functional group as the maximum over all the maximum sizes of reference species.   
ecology and estimatedepth,Benthic Demersal and Pelagic (from ecology) and Depth min and Depth Max (from estimatedepth),last rows of the matrix given in predation-accessibility.csv,0.8,matrix of the theoretical accessibility coefficients of background functional groups to the life stages of focal functional groups. These are parameters that can be obtained from queries in FishBase/SeaLifeBase as described in the following issue: jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/93 
eggs,Eggsdiammod,species.egg.size.sp,0.1,Egg size (in cm). This is a parameter that can directly be obtained from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
eggs,Eggsdiammod,species.egg.weight.sp,0.00053669,Egg weight (in g). This is a parameter than can be easily estimated from egg size as described in https://github.com/jhpoelen/fb-osmose-bridge/issues/86
popqb,Mortality,mortality.natural.rate.sp,0.2,Natural mortality rate due to causes not explicitly considered in OSMOSE such as predation by marine mammals and seabirds. This parameter can be obtained directly from FishBase/SeaLifeBase
